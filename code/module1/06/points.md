### In this lesson, you will learn about:

- Exploring how built-in functions like len(), round(), print(), get_llm_response() and print_llm_response() can perform actions on data. 

- Understanding how to call functions and utilize their returned values in your code. 

- Saving the outputs of functions into variables for later use in your programs.

- Integrating functions with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create dynamic prompts and process responses.
