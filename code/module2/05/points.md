### In this lesson, you will learn about: 

- What boolean data types are, and the two possible values they can hold: `True` or `False`. 

- How to use comparison operators such as `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to compare numerical values and obtain a boolean result. 

- How to use the equality operator (`==`) to determine if two values are equal, and how it differs from the assignment operator (`=`).

- How to use logical operators `and` and `or` to combine boolean expressions and evaluate more complex conditions.
